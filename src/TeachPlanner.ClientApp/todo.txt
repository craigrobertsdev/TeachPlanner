A lesson plan should be allowed to change the number of periods it takes up when being modified.

To make this happen, the user should be asked if they are sure they want to make the change, and be warned that any data in an overwritten period will be lost.

The lessonPlan page will need to know about the dayPlanTemplate so it can perform checks on the client side.
It can be passed as a prop to the lessonPlan page.

On the server, the dayPlan will be saved and need to be linked to the week planner.

The DayPlan on the server needs to know about the breaks in the dayPlan as they can contain different duties that may need to change depending on the need of the school.
